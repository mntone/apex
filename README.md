## Gun Mechanics

All guns in Apex Legends:

- Are not hitscan
- Have bullet drop
- Do not suffer damage falloff
- Have consistent spray patterns

Damage numbers in Apex Legends are rounded up when they're shown to you.  For example, a leg shot from a Wingman appears to do 41 damage when in reality it is doing 40.5 damage.

## Gun Statistics

The statistics I will present for each gun are:

| Statistic | Explanation |
| --- | --- |
| Projectile Speed | The speed the bullet is shot at, giving you a rough metric for how severe the falloff will be.  Faster bullets, less falloff. |
| Leg/Body/Head DMG | What damage is inflicted to the Legs/Body/Head respectively. |
| Rounds per Minute | How many bullets the gun can fire in a minute excluding reloads but considering things like burst fire. |
| Optimal DPS | How much damage can be done in a second of continuous fire **to the chest.**  I'm using the chest in this metric since it is more realistic and not unusably inflated like headshot damage. |
| Ammo type | Which ammunition type the gun uses. |
| Mag size | How many bullets can be fired before reload. |
| Reload times | How long it takes to reload the gun in seconds.  There are two types of reloads in ~~Titanfall~~ Apex: tactical reloads occur when reloading while there is still ammunition in the magazine and are faster.  Empty reloads are slower. |
| Fire modes | Auto, burst, semi-auto, bolt action, pump, etc. |
| Draw time | How fast the weapon is readied after sprinting. |
